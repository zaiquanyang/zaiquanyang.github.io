## styleGAN_v1
- A Style-Based Generator Architecture for Generative Adversarial Networks
  - `If a latent space is sufficiently disentangled, it should be possible to find direction vectors that consistently correspond to individual factors of variation`
  - `We would like to encourage that a fixed-size step in W results in a non-zero, fixed-magnitude change in the image. We can measure the deviation from this ideal empirically
by stepping into random directions in the image space and observing the corresponding w gradients. These gradients should have close to an equal length regardless of w or the
image-space direction, indicating that the mapping from the latent space to image space is well-conditioned.`
