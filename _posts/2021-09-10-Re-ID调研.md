# 任务介绍

[CSDN博客](https://blog.csdn.net/mzpmzk/article/details/81844261)

## DA Re-ID

- IDM: An Intermediate Domain Module for Domain Adaptive Person Re-ID
  - ICCV 2021 oral
  - Author: Peking University
  - [github](https://github.com/SikaStar/IDM)
  - **Motivation** and **Contribution**
    - Existing methods have made great progress in UDA re-ID, but they have not explicitly considered the bridging between the two extreme domains, i.e.,what information about the similarity/dissimilarity of the two domains can be utilized to tackle the UDA re-ID task. We explicitly and comprehensively investigate into the bridging between the source and target domains.
    - 在DA-ReID基于MixUp的思想，设计IDM模块去有效混合源域和目标域样本，使用生成的中间域样本去辅助原先任务的训练.
